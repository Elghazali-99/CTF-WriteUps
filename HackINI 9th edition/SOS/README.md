## Solution
the text looks like a morse code
after the decoding using the https://morsedecoder.com/ :

 the output contains some 'BREAK' after every sequence of 'TEETE....'
with a simple python code i splitted the decoded text and replaced the 'T' by '0' and 'E' by '1'
```ss = s.split('BREAK')

for i in ss:
    i=i.replace('T','0')
    i=i.replace('E','1')
    print(i) 
```
on the output i noticed a square, so to make it clearer i replaced 'T' by 'â–ˆ' and 'E' by ' '

after that i copied the output to texteditor, removed the line spacing, to get something looks like a QR code that is called Aztec Barcode
